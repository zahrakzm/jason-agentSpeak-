= What You Will Build

In this document, you will build an environment to develop agent-based system with link:https://github.com/jason-lang/jason[Jason] language.

= Installation

1. Install link:https://www.oracle.com/java/technologies/javase/jdk17-archive-downloads.html[Java 17]
1. Install link:https://code.visualstudio.com/download[Visual Sudio Code]
1. [windows] Install a terminal & shell tool like link:https://gitforwindows.org/[GitBash]

You can test the installation running VSCode, opening a terminal and executing `java --version`. The screen should look as follows.

You can now install Jason from link:https://github.com/jason-lang/jason/releases[here]. Download the `jason-bin-.....zip` file and decompress it. It creates a directory with Jason documentation, examples, and a sub-directory `bin` with the file *`jason`*. It is a unix executable file, if not, change its properties with `chmod +x jason`. Finally, link:https://www.computerhope.com/issues/ch000549.htm[adds the directory `bin` in your machine `PATH`] so that the command `jason` can be executed in a terminal. 

You may need to close and open VSCode again, then in its terminal type `jason --version`:

----
~ jason --version
Jason CLI 3.2
----

It means your installation is fine!

= Create and run a new application

In the terminal, you can create a new Jason application, named `app1`, with the following command:

----
jason app create app1
----

A folder `app1` is created for the application. Now you  can open it with VSCode:

image:./figs/app-files.png[application]

It has two agents (bob and alice) sharing a common environment. The code of the agents are in `src/agt`. The code of the environment is in `src/env`.

It would be useful to install a VSCode plugin that provides link:https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=tabajara-krausburg.jacamo4code[syntax highlight] for Jason.

You can execute the application with

----
cd app1
jason app1.mas2j -v
----

The two agents print a hello world message. 

NOTE: The first time you run a Jason application, it may take a while to start, since Gradle is being used and it downloads all dependencies.

You can now change the code of your application and evolve the code of your agents.

Just as an example, change the code of `alice.asl` to

----
!start.

+!start <- .send(bob,tell,hello).
----

executes the system again, open the link:http://127.0.0.1:3272[mind inspector], and see bob's beliefs.

= More on Jason CLI

To add more agents in your project:

----
jason app add-agent karlos
